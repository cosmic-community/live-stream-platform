## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> No content model prompt provided - app built from existing content structure

### Code Generation Prompt

> "Create a full-stack live-streaming app using Next.js (React) and Node.js. Specs:
> 
> Backend (pages/api):
> 
> Use Next.js API routes with socket.io for signaling (offer/answer/ICE).
> 
> No database needed.
> 
> Frontend (React):
> 
> Two pages: /broadcast and /watch.
> 
> On /broadcast:
> 
> Buttons: 'Start Camera', 'Start Screen Share', and 'End Stream'.
> 
> Capture media with getUserMedia and getDisplayMedia.
> 
> Use a single RTCPeerConnection; add tracks to it.
> 
> Send SDP and ICE candidates via socket.io to the server, broadcast to watchers.
> 
> On /watch:
> 
> Connect to the same socket.io channel; receive SDP offer, answer, ICE.
> 
> Attach incoming media to a <video> element.
> 
> Extra details:
> 
> Include STUN server config (stun:stun.l.google.com:19302).
> 
> Handle multiple watchers gracefully (one-to-many).
> 
> Provide full code, file structure, and step-by-step comments."

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **Socket.IO** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **WebRTC** - Peer-to-peer streaming technology
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Hooks** - Modern React state management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Bun (recommended) or npm
- Modern browser with WebRTC support
- HTTPS for production (required for getUserMedia)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd live-stream-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

4. **Open the application**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Go to `/broadcast` to start streaming
   - Go to `/watch` to view streams

### Usage

#### Broadcasting
1. Visit `/broadcast`
2. Click "Start Camera" to begin camera streaming
3. Or click "Start Screen Share" for screen capture
4. Share the watch link with viewers
5. Click "End Stream" to stop broadcasting

#### Watching
1. Visit `/watch` while a stream is active
2. Video will automatically load when broadcaster starts
3. Real-time connection status indicators

## üîß Socket.IO Integration

The application uses Socket.IO for WebRTC signaling:

```typescript
// Example: Sending offer to watchers
socket.emit('offer', {
  sdp: peerConnection.localDescription,
  streamId: 'main-stream'
});

// Example: Receiving answer from watcher
socket.on('answer', async (data) => {
  await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(data.sdp);
});
```

## üì° WebRTC Configuration

The app uses Google's STUN servers for NAT traversal:

```typescript
const rtcConfiguration = {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }
  ]
};
```

## üåê Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Deploy automatically on push to main branch
3. HTTPS is provided automatically for WebRTC compatibility

### Netlify
1. Build command: `bun run build`
2. Publish directory: `out` or `.next`
3. Enable HTTPS for production usage

### Environment Variables
No environment variables required for basic functionality.

### Production Notes
- HTTPS is required for `getUserMedia` and `getDisplayMedia`
- Consider implementing authentication for private streams
- Monitor bandwidth usage for multiple concurrent viewers
- Add error logging and analytics for production monitoring

## üîí Security Considerations

- All WebRTC connections are peer-to-peer encrypted
- No video data passes through the server
- Socket.IO handles only signaling data
- Consider adding authentication for production use
